# Agentic Scan

Agentic Scan is a modern, web-based security scanning dashboard that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide autonomous, intelligent network scanning and enumeration. It offers a user-friendly interface for launching scans, viewing results, and receiving AI-powered remediation advice, all wrapped in a sleek, themeable UI.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Scan Dashboard**: An at-a-glance overview of your security posture, with dynamically generated stats from your scan history and a weekly scan activity chart.
- **Agentic New Scans**: Easily configure and launch new scans with robust form validation. The system is designed to allow an AI agent to interpret scan parameters and make intelligent decisions.
- **Detailed & Sortable Scan Reports**: Drill down into individual scan results to see an AI-generated summary and risk score. The results table is fully interactive, allowing you to sort by target, risk score, or date.
- **AI-Powered Analysis & Remediation**: Utilizes Genkit and Google's Gemini model to analyze raw scan data, generate a summary and risk score, and provide actionable remediation suggestions.
- **Scheduled Scans**: Automate your security assessments by scheduling recurring scans (UI only).
- **Responsive & Themed UI**: A clean, responsive interface built with ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js, featuring both light and dark modes that follow a professional color palette.
