# Agentic Scan

Agentic Scan is a modern, web-based security scanning dashboard that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide autonomous, intelligent network scanning and enumeration. It offers a user-friendly interface for launching scans, viewing results, and receiving AI-powered remediation advice.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Scan Dashboard**: An at-a-glance overview of your security posture, including key metrics and weekly scan activity.
- **New Scans**: Easily configure and launch new scans with various options like scan mode (Quick, Full, Stealth), scan types (Port Scan, OS Detection), and credentials for authenticated scans.
- **Detailed Scan Reports**: Drill down into individual scan results to see a summary, risk score, open ports, detected vulnerabilities, and the raw scan output.
- **AI Remediation Advisor**: Utilizes Genkit and Google's Gemini model to analyze scan findings and provide actionable remediation suggestions.
- **Scheduled Scans**: Automate your security assessments by scheduling recurring scans.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, responsive interface built with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly across devices.
